1.7.5
- Added impact bomb - now can trigger explosions on collisions!
- Improved move-n'-rotate tool - it's easier to impart inertia now!
- Lowered global damp
- Global strength now auto-adjusts based on simulation quality
- Fixed bug with alignment of texture and structure in multi-layer ships

1.7.0
- Musical theme for this release: Chemical Brothers, "We Are the Night"
- Added ephemeral particles sub-system, and used it for debris and sparkles from the chainsaw
- Improved quality of the rigidity simulation - bodies are now stiffer
- Revisited simulations of water drag (now correctly proportional to *square* of particle velocity) and collisions with ocean floor
- Added tool to move and rotate bodies
- Added stars - visible only in the night sky (thanks Pac0master!)
- Added ocean floor bump maps
- Many more physical and graphical parameters are now adjustable
- Added separate volume control for tools' sounds
- Fixed bug with line artifacts on textures under some GPUs

1.6.0
- Musical theme for this release: Blonde Redhead, "23"
- Added anti-matter bomb
- Added more control over sound effects and music
- Game now starts in full-screen mode, and user can switch back and forth between full-screen mode and normal-screen mode
- Paid off considerably technical debt in the OpenGL domain, with 20% performance improvement in the rendering subsystem
- Another 10% performance improvement in the water and land contour interpolation
- Revised bomb blast simulations
- Lots of new ships, thanks to many contributors

1.5.0
- Completely redesigned water flooding, and added splash sounds when waves break inside a physical body
- Added ability to draw vector fields
- Added probes, to display real-time scalar time series
- Redesigned settings dialog

1.4.0
- Lamps are now powered by generators and electrical cables, and they flicker and turn off when the circuit
  is broken or the connected generator becomes wet
- Added sound of water rushing in the ship
- Improved smoothing of panning and zooming
- Added help with basic instructions
- Added new ship - "SS Queen of Unova" (thanks OceanLinerOrca!)

1.3.0
- Completely redesigned the physics of buoyancy, and as a consequence overhauled the material system
- Fixed bug with ocean depth adjustment
- Added a few more ships

1.2.0
- Added ability to pin points - freezing them at their current position
- Added ability to place remote-controlled and timer bombs (thanks Mart!)
- Added chainsaw to cut ship in pieces 
- Added magic swirl force

1.1.0
 - Completely rewritten all data structures to maximize data locality - a performance gain of 50%!
 - Rewritten dynamics integration step to make full use of packed SSE floating point instructions on Intel x86
 - Rewritten dynamics layer as force-based rather than position-based
 - Revisited tessellation algorithm, cutting in half the number of triangles that have to be rendered

1.0.1
 - Ship and land textures are now mipmapped

1.0
 - Sounds and music (on cue)
 - Textures for ships, land, water, and clouds in the sky
 - Ropes
 - Connected component detection for ship pieces, so they hide each other correctly
 - The strength of the smash and grab tools depends on how long the mouse button is kept pressed for
 - Menu and keyboard shortcuts (+/-) for zoom
 - New settings window
 - Application icon and cursors
