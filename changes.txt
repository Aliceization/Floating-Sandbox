  when waves break inside a physical body
- Added ability to draw vector fields
- Added probes, to display real-time scalar time series
- Redesigned settings dialog

1.4.0
- Lamps are now powered by generators and electrical cables, and they flicker and turn off when the circuit

1.1.0
 - Completely rewritten all data structures to maximize data locality - a performance gain of 50%!
 - Rewritten dynamics integration step to make full use of packed SSE floating point instructions on Intel x86
 - Rewritten dynamics layer as force-based rather than position-based
 - Revisited tessellation algorithm, cutting in half the number of triangles that have to be rendered

1.0.1
 - Ship and land textures are now mipmapped

1.0
 - Sounds and music (on cue)
 - Textures for ships, land, water, and clouds in the sky
